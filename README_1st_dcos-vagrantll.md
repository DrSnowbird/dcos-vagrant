# Import to know that you have to use VirtualBox 5.0.24 to avoid unnecessary errors during the roll out of Vagrant using Virtualbox due to the VM images used by DC/OS vagrant is 5.0.24. 

## Though, you can use "vagrant plug-in manager for VirtualBox". But, I don't have much luck for many trials and failures. Finally, I reinstall (from clean slate) for VirtualBox 5.0.24 with matching VirtualBox extension and everything just work perfectly!

# Again, Use VirtualBox 5.0.24!!
